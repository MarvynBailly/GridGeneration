Along the sides of the blocks, we solve a 1D grid-spacing problem through the calculus of variation whose solution gives a coordinate mapping for the distribution of points according to the metric tensor. An algebraic method known as Transfinite Interpolation is used to fill in each block by interpolating the distribution of points along the edges into 2D. Supporting mathematical steps are shown in the Appendix.","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/ODEFormulation.html#General-Grid-Spacing-Problem","page":"ODE Formulation","title":"General Grid-Spacing Problem","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"pages/ODEFormulation.html","page":"ODE Formulation","title":"ODE Formulation","text":"We define the metric","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/ODEFormulation.html","page":"ODE Formulation","title":"ODE Formulation","text":"m_alpha(x_s x s) = sigma_alpha^2  M x_s^2 - 1","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/ODEFormulation.html","page":"ODE Formulation","title":"ODE Formulation","text":"where M(x(s)) is the metric tensor field designed from the residual posterior estimate, x is the physical domain and s is the computational domain.
