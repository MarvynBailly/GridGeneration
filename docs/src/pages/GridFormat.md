# Grid Format

To save multi-block grids, we will use "Tortuga Format" used by Dr. Larsson's [Computational Turbulence Laboratory](https://larsson.umd.edu/research/). 

The format saves three pieces of information which can easily be dumped to binary and loaded into his in-house solver. All grids inputted into GridGeneration.jl are expected to be in this format.
